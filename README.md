# This project is moving.

This project is moving. It was being developed on a platform called Assembly, which has moved on to creating a really cool [changelog product](https://assembly.com). If you want to help out on this project, you can do so at http://github.com/bigblind/podato.

#### Made by Assembly

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
